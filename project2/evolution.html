      <h3> The 1975 (self-titled)</h3>
      <p>
      In their first self titled album, the 1975 aimed to have album
      artwork that was both “chic and simple.” Inspired by the Chanel logo,
      the 1975 created a brand off of a simple neon rectangle in black and
      white. Their almost 80s vibe also appeared in the rest of the album’s
      artwork, with photos taken for each song by George Daniel, a member of
      the band. “We wanted something to look like a brand than a band,” Healy said.
