        <h3> The 1975 (self-titled)</h3>
        <p>
          In their first self titled album, the 1975 aimed to have album
          artwork that was both “chic and simple.” Inspired by the Chanel logo,
          the 1975 created a brand off of a simple neon rectangle in black and
          white. Their almost 80s vibe also appeared in the rest of the album’s
          artwork, with photos taken for each song by George Daniel, a member of
          the band. “We wanted something to look like a brand than a band,” Healy said.

    <h4> I Like it When You Sleep, for You Are So Beautiful
      Yet So Unaware of It</h4>
    <p>
      The 1975 made a big shift in their second album, with the new addition
      of color and graphic designer, Samuel Burgess Johnson. While “there was
      so much aesthetic identity with the box… the black and white thing had to
      change,” Healy claimed. After touring, Healy noticed fans on Tumblr becoming
      bored with the old album artwork without “new visual information,” so they
      began posting new edits of the bands album in pink. With this insight,
      the band used neon pink signs for their new album art and song visuals.

    <h3>A Brief Inquiry Into Online Relationships</h3>
    <p> In a more honest third album, Healy wasn’t worried on its presentation.
      This mindset came across clearly in their album art designed by Johnson
      that “wasn’t really referencing anything, [but] was more of a clean, modern,
      deconstruction.” This album, in Healy’s mind, was more of an ode to creativity,
      as he claimed himself to be “self-referential” and obsessed with alluding
      to other content creators and their important works.

<h4>Notes on a Conditional Form (NOAF)</h4>
<p>
  In Healy’s own words, NOAF is more of a “wabi sabi album,” based on the Japanese concept of acceptance in imperfection. With this in mind, the band’s album art contains more texture, visual content, and simplicity than their previous albums.
