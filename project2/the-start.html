    <p class='first-column'> The band’s origins trace to their attendance at high school and playing
      together as teenagers. Gigs organized by a council worker led the band to
      formally sign with Dirty Hit and Polydor Records. The band opened for
      several major acts and released a series of extended plays (Facedown, Sex,
       Music for Cars, IV) throughout 2012 before releasing their self-titled
       debut album (2013), which included the popular singles “Sex”,
       “Chocolate”, and “Robbers” and reached number one in the
      United Kingdom. </p>
<div class='first-column'>

      <p>Their second album, I Like It When You Sleep, for You Are So Beautiful
        yet So Unaware of It (2016), reached No. 1 in the US, UK, Canada,
        Australia and New Zealand. Following the touring cycle for the record,
        the band announced their third album under the working title of Music
        for Cars, before going on hiatus again throughout 2017. </p>

        <p> Returning in 2018, the band announced that the album had evolved
          into their third campaign cycle, consisting of their third and fourth
          studio albums. The first, A Brief Inquiry into Online Relationships
          (2018), was released to widespread critical acclaim, and became their
          third No. 1 album in the UK. The second, Notes on a Conditional Form,
          was released in May 2020 and became their fourth consecutive No.
          1 album in the UK. </p>
</div>
        <p class='first-column'> The 1975 has garnered acclaim for their exploration of an eclectic
          range of genres such as pop rock, synth-pop, R&B, funk rock,
          electropop, new wave forms of electronic music (such as UK garage,
          2-step and ambient),and forms of rock music (such as shoegaze,
          post-punk and post-rock),as well as elements of jazz, soul and gospel.
           Frontman Matty Healy’s energetic and eccentric stage presence has
           also garnered acclaim, as has his lyricism due to its deeply
           personal, self-aware, self-deprecating, and often observational
           nature; his lyrical analyses of politics, society and culture have
           been praised, notable in songs such as “Love It If We Made It”,
           “Loving Someone”, “Sincerity Is Scary”, and “People”. </p>
