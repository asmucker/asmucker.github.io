        <p>Making a Change
          From projecting the pride flag during their live performances of “Loving
          Someone” to addressing climate change on their upcoming album, The 1975
          does not shy from commenting on current events. But, of course,
          that’s one of the reasons fans love them. There are plenty of times
          The 1975 made statements with their music, but here are a few of the most
          notable political statements by the band.</p>

      <h5>During their live performances of ‘Loving Someone’ </h5>
      <p> In 2016, The 1975 premiered their album, I Like It When You Sleep, for
        You Are So Beautiful Yet So Unaware of It and their song “Loving Someone.”
         Although the song originally discussed Matty’s life and feelings, it came
         to represent something much bigger.  Following the mass shooting at the
         Pulse Nightclub in Orlando, The 1975 dedicated “Loving Someone” to
         members of the LGBTQ+ community. The group projected a pride flag behind
         them during a performance of “Loving Someone,” which eventually became a
         trademark of the song and of their live shows.</p>

        <h5>During their acceptance speech at the ‘Brit Awards’ </h5>
        <p>In 2019, The 1975 won the Brit Award for “Album of the Year.”
          The band used their platform to discuss current events and the state of
          the music industry. Specifically, Matty Healy touched on how women in the
          music industry are perceived. </p>
          <p>“I want to read a couple of sentences that a friend of ours, Laura Snapes, said this week and I thought we should all think about it,” Healy said. “In music, male misogynist acts are examined for nuance and defended as traits of difficult artists while women are treated as hysterics who ‘don’t understand art.'”</p>

<h5>With their re-imagined version of ‘The 1975,’ featuring Greta Thunberg </h5>
<p></p>
<p>Since their self-titled record, The 1975 always opened their albums with a song
   entitled “The 1975.” For their upcoming album, entitled Notes on a Conditional Form,
   their signature song took on a different meaning. Narrated by activist Greta Thunberg,
   this song discusses climate change and a time for civil disobedience and rebellion.
