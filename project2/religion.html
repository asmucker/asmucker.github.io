        <h3> Spirituality and concept of religion </h3>

        <p> In a lot of the 1975’s music, Matty healy goes back and forth in his
          understanding of religion and spirituality. It is almost a love hate
          kind of relationship. Having said this, Healy admits to be openly agnostic.
          Even so, Healy uses his songs as a journal to explain where he's at and
          reason why he’s struggled in the past with religion. His songs titled “Give Yourself
          A Try,” “If I Believe You,” as well as “Jesus Christ 2005 God Bless
          America,” go into a more in depth explanation as to what he believes
          and why.</p>

      <h4> If I believe you</h4>
     “I’ve got a God-shaped hole/ That’s infected/ And I’m petrified of being
        alone now,” Healy begins his song. “If I Believe,” is an explanation of Healy’s
        relationship with religion and the universe. “If I believe, will that make
        it stop? I’m begging for help/I’m asking you Jesus, show yourself,” Healy sings.
        He later adds that “I’ll be a child if you exist,” referring to the biblical
        concept of being a a child of God. In several points in the song, Healy builds
        off of this concept as he shapes his song to have a more gospel like feel,
        as he includes a choir of gospel singers in several sections.</p>

        <h4>Jesus Christ 2005 God Bless America </h4>
        <p> The entirety of this song is basically a metaphor of Healy’s “frustration
          at the way religious society handles topics such as homosexuality” (dbknews).
          He begins the song a bit ironically by stating that he’s “in love with Jesus
          Christ, [and] it’s so nice.” Later on, Healy describes his scorn for religion,
          when he wonders out loud why the church claims to be welcoming, yet often pushes
          out those who are different or identify as lgbtq+. </p>
