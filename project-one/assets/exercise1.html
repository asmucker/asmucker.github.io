            <h2>Red Rose / Regular</h2>
            <p>Red Rose was designed by Jaikishan Patel and released in 2018 by his
  independently owned and operated company, MagicType, in Mumbai, India
  (<a href= "www.behance.net/gallery/62056551/Red-Rose-Pro-Free-Font"> Red Rose</a>).
  Red Rose is an exclusively designed Latin typeface, inspired by the Serifs
  typeface. Its distinguishing factors are its triangular-shaped serif design
  and curved strokes near the end of the axes. I was drawn to Red Rose because
  of its unique flared character strokes and medium contrast in stroke weight.</p>
